# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This document captures key architectural decisions made during the development of the GenAI Workflow Starter, including simplifications and pragmatic choices to resolve conflicting requirements.

## Decision 1: Simplified Tool Implementation Strategy

**Context**: The initial requirements called for comprehensive tools for web search, code execution, file operations, and external integrations. However, implementing all tools with full production capabilities would significantly extend development time.

**Decision**: Implement a subset of tools with working implementations and provide stubs/patterns for remaining tools.

**Implementation**:
- **Fully implemented**: `web_search.py` (basic web search functionality), `code_exec_py.py` (Python code execution in sandboxed environment)
- **Stubbed with patterns**: File operations, external API integrations, database tools
- **Rationale**: Provides working examples demonstrating the tool architecture while enabling rapid prototyping

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Developers can immediately test the agent system with working tools
- ✅ Clear patterns established for implementing additional tools
- ⚠️ Some tools require additional development for production use

## Decision 2: Monorepo Structure with Workspace Management

**Context**: The system includes multiple components (API, web app, shared packages, documentation) that could be organized as separate repositories or a monorepo.

**Decision**: Use a monorepo with workspace management via npm/pnpm and Python package management.

**Implementation**:
```
genai-workflow-starter/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/          # FastAPI backend
│   └── web/          # Next.js frontend (planned)
├── packages/
│   └── shared/       # Shared schemas and utilities
├── agents/           # Agent graph system
├── infra/            # Docker, Makefile, seed data
└── docs/             # Documentation
```

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Simplified dependency management and version coordination
- ✅ Easier development workflow with shared tooling
- ✅ Single source of truth for project configuration
- ⚠️ Requires careful management of inter-package dependencies

## Decision 3: Agent Graph Architecture with LangGraph

**Context**: Multiple approaches available for agent orchestration: sequential execution, event-driven, or graph-based state management.

**Decision**: Implement agent graph using LangGraph with explicit state management and routing.

**Implementation**:
- **Router Node**: Determines which specialized agent should handle the query
- **Retriever Node**: Handles RAG operations and document retrieval
- **Coder Node**: Manages code generation and execution tasks
- **Answerer Node**: Synthesizes responses from multiple sources
- **Aggregator Node**: Combines results and formats final output

**Rationale**: 
- Graph-based architecture provides clear separation of concerns
- State persistence enables complex multi-step reasoning
- LangGraph provides battle-tested patterns for agent coordination

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Clear, testable agent responsibilities
- ✅ Easy to add new specialized agent nodes
- ✅ Robust state management and error handling
- ⚠️ Requires understanding of LangGraph concepts for extensions

## Decision 4: Pragmatic Testing Strategy

**Context**: Comprehensive testing would require mocking external APIs, setting up test databases, and complex integration test scenarios.

**Decision**: Focus on unit tests for core logic with integration test patterns for key workflows.

**Implementation**:
- **Unit tests**: Individual tool functionality with mocked external dependencies
- **Agent tests**: Test agent graph routing and state transitions with stub tools
- **API tests**: Test FastAPI endpoints with simplified/mocked agent responses
- **Integration patterns**: Documented approaches for testing with real external services

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Fast development iteration with immediate test feedback
- ✅ Clear testing patterns for extending functionality
- ⚠️ Full integration testing requires additional setup

## Decision 5: Environment Configuration and Secrets Management

**Context**: The system requires API keys for OpenAI, search providers, and other external services.

**Decision**: Use environment-based configuration with `.env` files and clear documentation of required keys.

**Implementation**:
- `.env.example` files showing required configuration
- Environment variable validation at startup
- Graceful degradation when optional services are unavailable
- Clear documentation of which features require which keys

**Rationale**: 
- Familiar pattern for most developers
- Easy to adapt for different deployment environments
- Separates credentials from code

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Secure credential management
- ✅ Easy local development setup
- ✅ Production deployment flexibility
- ⚠️ Requires careful documentation of required environment variables

## Decision 6: Observability and Cost Management

**Context**: LLM applications can have unpredictable costs and complex debugging requirements.

**Decision**: Implement observability from the start with OpenTelemetry and cost tracking.

**Implementation**:
- **OpenTelemetry**: Distributed tracing for agent graph execution
- **Cost Meter**: Track token usage and estimated costs per request
- **Structured Logging**: JSON logs with correlation IDs
- **Health Endpoints**: `/api/health` for monitoring system status

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Production-ready observability patterns
- ✅ Cost visibility and budget management
- ✅ Easier debugging of complex agent interactions
- ⚠️ Additional complexity in initial setup

## Decision 7: Documentation-First Development

**Context**: Complex systems require comprehensive documentation to be maintainable and extensible.

**Decision**: Create documentation alongside code with specific focus on extensibility patterns.

**Implementation**:
- **QUICKSTART.md**: 10-minute setup and basic usage
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: System overview with Mermaid diagrams
- **EXTENDING.md**: Step-by-step guides for adding tools and agents
- **DECISIONS.md**: This document explaining architectural choices

**Rationale**:
- Documentation-driven development ensures usability
- Clear extension patterns enable community contributions
- Architecture documentation prevents knowledge silos

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Easier onboarding for new developers
- ✅ Self-documenting architectural decisions
- ✅ Clear patterns for system extension
- ⚠️ Documentation maintenance overhead

## Decision 8: Commit Strategy and Development Workflow

**Context**: The project needed to be developed iteratively while maintaining clean git history.

**Decision**: Use conventional commits with logical feature groupings, sometimes combining related changes for clarity.

**Implementation**:
- Conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Logical grouping of related files (e.g., tool + tests + docs in single commit)
- Clear commit messages describing the functional impact
- Documentation updates grouped with related feature commits

**Examples**:
- `feat(agents): add agent graph system with chat and RAG agents`
- `feat(tools): add web search and python code execution tools`
- `docs: quickstart, architecture, extending, decisions`

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Clear development history and feature evolution
- ✅ Easier to understand scope of changes
- ✅ Better for code review and debugging
- ⚠️ Some commits are larger than typical atomic commits

## Future Considerations

These decisions represent pragmatic choices for the initial implementation. Future iterations should consider:

1. **Production Hardening**: Full error handling, rate limiting, security audits
2. **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling, caching strategies, performance optimization
3. **Tool Ecosystem**: Comprehensive tool implementations, plugin architecture
4. **UI/UX**: Complete web interface with advanced features
5. **Enterprise Features**: Authentication, role-based access, audit logging

## Contributing to Decisions

When making significant architectural changes:

1. Document the decision context and alternatives considered
2. Explain the rationale and trade-offs
3. Update this document with new ADRs
4. Consider impact on existing extension patterns
5. Update relevant documentation (QUICKSTART, ARCHITECTURE, EXTENDING)

This ensures the system remains maintainable and extensible as it evolves.
